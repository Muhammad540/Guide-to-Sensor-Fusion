# 🎉 Welcome to the Sensor Fusion & Filtering Guide!

This repo is your go-to resource for understanding and practically implementing different filtering techniques in **ROS2**! 🚀 Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, you’ll find everything you need to confidently tune and test sensor fusion algorithms. 💡

## 📝 How to Get Started

1. **Read Before You Run**  
   Head over to `ws/docs` 📚 and explore the filter you're interested in. For example, if you're excited about **AMCL/ParticleFiltering** 🧠, read the Jupyter notebook provided. This will help you understand the theory before jumping into ROS2.

2. **Test in ROS2**  
   Once you've got the theory down, close the notebook and dive into the **ROS2** workspace. By testing the algorithm yourself, you’ll feel more confident when it's time to tweak and tune! 🛠️

## 🐳 Everything is Dockerized!

No need to worry about installing **ROS2** or any other packages. We've made it super easy for you! Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   Create a folder on your PC called `ros2_ws`, then clone this repository into it. 📂

2. **Use VS Code**  
   Open the `Sensor-Fusion` folder using **Visual Studio Code**. Make sure you have Docker installed on your PC and the Docker extension for VS Code installed.

3. **Let the Magic Happen**  
   VS Code will automatically build and run the Docker container for you. 🎉 You'll find yourself inside a ready-to-go workspace with everything set up!

## 🐢 TurtleBot3 Simulation Included

We’ve integrated the **TurtleBot3** simulation for quick testing of the algorithms! 🐢 Head to the README inside the `ws` folder to see how to run each algorithm. Feel free to play around, tweak settings, and explore. Have fun experimenting! 🧪
